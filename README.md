# APEX Stew - Code Repository

![APEX Stew Banner](APEX_STEW_Banner.png)

Welcome to the official code repository for the **APEX Stew** YouTube channel! Here you'll find all the source code, configuration files, and snippets featured in my short and sharp explainer videos.

As a technology evangelist and developer who loves the power of low-code solutions, my goal with APEX Stew is to provide quick, practical tutorials that get straight to the point. This repository is a companion to those videos, giving you the resources you need to follow along and get your hands on the technology.

## üìÇ How This Repository is Organised

This repository is organised by video topic. Each video that has associated code will have its own dedicated folder. The folder name will correspond to the title of the YouTube video, making it easy to find what you're looking for.

For example, the code for a video titled "Automating Your Workflow with Low-Code Magic" will be located in the `/automating-your-workflow-with-low-code-magic` directory.

### Inside Each Folder

Within each project folder, you will typically find:

* **`src/` or `code/`**: The main source code for the tutorial.
* **`README.md`**: A specific README for that project with detailed instructions, command snippets, and any special considerations.
* **Configuration files**: Any necessary configuration files (e.g., `config.json`, `docker-compose.yml`).
* **Assets**: Any images, data files, or other assets used in the video.
